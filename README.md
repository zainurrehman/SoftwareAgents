Projects related to Ottawa/Carleton University Course SYSC5103

The folders for server and monitor are on the main page SoftwareAgents. They work for all projects i.e. reactive agent, state based agent, expert system and BDI agent.

To run the code (for the BDI agent as an example): 
Go to the rcssserver folder and run the rcsssserver.exe executable. 
After that go to the rcssmonitor folder and run the rcssmonitor.exe executable. 
Then go to the BDI folder -> Krislet folder and run the TeamStart.bat. After this wait for all the players to connect. 
Once the players are all connected, go to the referee tab on the monitor and click on KickOff.
