//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,Power/Angle,Direction
//BallSeenByPlayer is a set with values {Y,N,F}
//BallCloseToPlayer is a set with values {Y,N,U}
//GoalVisibility is a set with values {Y,N,F}
//Power/Angle is needed when the Action is kick or dash. Otherwise, put x for power/angle.
//Direction is needed when Action is kick or turn. Otherwise, put x for direction
//Note that power/angle means power OR angle. Both are integers and for simplicity, I have used the variable "Power" in the Brain.java when parsing the text file.
//
//When kick is necessary:
//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,power/angle,Direction
F, Y, F -> Kick,100,goal
Y, Y, F -> Kick,100,goal
Y, Y, Y -> Kick,100,goal

//When turning towards the goal is necessary
//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,power/angle,Direction
F, Y, Y -> Turn,x,goal

//When dash is necessary
//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,power/angle,Direction
F, N, F -> Dash,100,x
F, N, Y -> Dash,100,x
F, N, N -> Dash,100,x

//When turn to ball direction is necessary
//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,power/angle,Direction
Y, N, F -> Turn,x,ball
Y, N, N -> Turn,x,ball
Y, N, Y -> Turn,x,ball

//When turn at 40 int power is necessary
//BallSeenByPlayer,BallCloseToPlayer,GoalVisibility->Action,power/angle,Direction
N, U, N -> Turn,40,x
N, U, Y -> Turn,40,x
F, Y, N -> Turn,40,x
Y, Y, N -> Turn,40,x
N, U, N -> Turn,40,x
N, U, F -> Turn,40,x
